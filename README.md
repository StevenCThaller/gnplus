# GalNetPlus

## Initializing the Database
Manually create an empty database through something like MySQL workbench. As long as it has the same name as in your .env, you should be good to run:

`yarn migration:generate src/database/migrations/DevelopDBInit`

And then:

`yarn migration:run`

"# gnplus"  git init git add README.md git commit -m "first commit" git branch -M main git remote add origin git@github.com:StevenCThaller/gnplus.git git push -u origin main
